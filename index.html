						&emsp;Hello! My name is Christian Downs and you've just stumbled upon my website! I’m excited to give you a bit
						more
						information on myself then afterwards don’t be afraid to explore some of the projects I’ve completed some of them
						have only photos some have the full code implemented some will be games; enjoy yourself and then let me know what
						you think in the contact page!<br>
						
						&emsp;Well a little about me, I am a C#/.NET Software Developer who loves trying new things and excited to keep
						pushing
						my knowledge and what I can do next! I know a few languages those being C#, Java, Python, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript,
						Git, and Ruby. If you’d like to see some of my work you can head over to my <a href="https://github.com/Christian-Downs">Github</a>. My passion is programming! I
						love being able to work through problems and finally being able to have that concept come to life in front of me!
						I find that the best way to keep things exciting is to always be learning something new, for example at the time
						of writing I’m learning how to integrate virtual reality into this website! I find that to be able to keep up with
						not only the competition but my own hunger I constantly am pushing and creating. As you probably could have
						guessed I’m a massive geek and proud to be one! I think the best example of this, other than me being a
						programmer, is my hobbies. Although due to the virus I haven’t had much of the opportunities to do this much
						anymore I love Dungeons and Dragons! I love the creative openness and abundance of options to explore! I also, of
						course, love me a good video game. I’ve really been getting into virtual reality games, which inspired the vr page
						for this website. I also make games in virtual reality very basic ones, maybe you’ll find them on here eventually.<br>

						&emsp;Now is the time where I tell you a bit about my history and education. At time of writing, I have just
						graduated
						from a coding boot camp named <i>Claim Academy</i>. There I got a certification in C#/.NET Software Developer, it was
						also there where I built my capstone project <a href="roomie.html">Roomie</a> (go check out my project page or the
						link below for some more
						information on that). While I was at <i>Claim Academy</i> I expanded my knowledge of C# and Java and learned HTML, CSS
						and Javascript as well as how to use them in ASP.NET framework. I also learned how to make entity frameworks and
						how to use them with ADO.NET MVC. Before I went to Claim, I actually had just graduated from SouthWestern Illinois
						College with an associates in the arts.
